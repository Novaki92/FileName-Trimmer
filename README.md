# FileName-Trimmer
Trims the beginning and end of filenames for multiple files. 

This program was created entirely because of the excessive amounts of torrents with redundant file names. 

I have plans to eventually expand this to a gui program probably writtin in C# in the future. 

There could be potential bugs right now so use at your own risk on files that aren't important to you. 
************************************************************
- For Windows Users [Download](https://github.com/Novaki92/FileName-Trimmer/raw/master/dist/filename_trimmer.exe)

        1) .exe is in dist folder if download link isn't working

        2) place into directory you wish to trim file names

        3) follow prompts

    
- For Linux Users

        1) You're on Linux...I mean python is like the defualt man. Figure it out 

        2) But seriously just make sure you have python 3 and run from terminal like all other py scripts

        3) This script hasn't been tested on any Linux OS as of yet but it should run fine

        4) Oh and same as windows...Make sure filename_trimmer.py is in the folder you want to trim files
    
 
- For Programmers

        1) If you want an exe you'll need to download PyInstaller from http://www.pyinstaller.org/ 
        
        1.5) Or better yet just run 'pip install pyinstaller' in terminal/cmd

        2) Go to the correct directory that your .py script is in (in terminal/cmd)

        3) I personally run 'pyinstaller --onefile script.py' for sake of simplicity but you can use something else if you want

- inb4 FAQ:

        Q: Do I need to include a period when entering file extension?

        A: It's up to your preference...FileName Trimmer works fine with or without the period in the extension
        
        
        Q: Can I use this on files with numbers at the beginning? 
        
        A: If it's all the same number. Otherwise it wont work.
