# FileName-Trimmer
Trims the beginning and end of filenames for multiple files. 
************************************************************
- For Windows Users

        1) .exe is in dist folder

        2) place into directory you wish to trim file names

        3) follow prompts

    
- For Linux Users

      1. You're on Linux. I mean python is like the defualt man. Figure it out 

      2. But seriously just make sure you're on python 3 and run from terminal like all other py scripts

      3. This script hasn't been tested on any Linux OS as of yet but it should run fine

      4. Oh and same as windows. Make sure filename_trimmer.py is in the folder you want to trim files
    
 
- For Programmers

        If you want an exe you'll need to download PyInstaller from http://www.pyinstaller.org/

        Go to the correct directory that your .py script is in

        I personally run 'pyinstaller --onefile script.py' for sake of simplicity but you can use something else if you want

- inb4 FAQ:

        Do I need to include a period when entering file extension?

            It's up to your preference. FileName Trimmer works fine with or without the period in the extension
